After driving him around for three years as a red car, I decided to paint him in the style of the artist <A HREF="../mondrian/">Piet Mondrian</A>. Sadly, Leo passed away in spring 96, but I dedicate this page to his memory. I just thought you lot might be interested.<P>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD COLSPAN=2>            <CENTER><IMG SRC="TopPage.jpeg" ALT="Mondrian Car" WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=316><P></CENTER>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="../punch.gif" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=18 ALT=""></TD>        <TD><H1>Additional Information</H1>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD></TD>        <TD><MENU>    <LI> <A HREF="#I_Paint">How I Painted My Car</A> (production shots)    <LI> <A HREF="#You_Paint">How To Paint Your Car</A>    <LI> <A HREF="#Reactions">People's Reactions</A>    <LI> <A HREF="#Misc">Miscellaneous Bits & Bobs</A>    <LI> <A HREF="#Links">Other Painted Cars on the Web</A> (a list of links)</MENU>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD COLSPAN=2>            <CENTER><IMG SRC="LeftFront.jpeg" ALT="Left Front of Mondrian Car" WIDTH=380 HEIGHT=203></CENTER><P>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="../punch.gif" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=18 ALT=""></TD>        <TD><A NAME="I_Paint"><H1>How I Painted My Car</H1></A>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD></TD>        <TD>The following photograph shows Leo in the early stages of production, with the bonnet semi-completed, and only one side painted white.<P>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD COLSPAN=2>        	<CENTER> <A HREF=car_hidden.html BORDER=0><IMG SRC="car_half_done.jpeg" ALT="Leo in very early stages" WIDTH=218 HEIGHT=176 BORDER=0></A><P>        	</CENTER>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD></TD>        <TD>My basic approach was to start on the bonnet, and then move on to the rest of the car. Practising on the bonnet would give you something instantly recognisable, and is easy to over paint if it all goes wrong.<P>The base colour was just painted on with a couple of coats of primer followed by the paint. Then leave for a week so that it completely dries, and then mark out your lines with masking tape. Then secure three to four layers of newspaper to the masking tape with more masking tape, to make sure that the paint doesn't go where you don't want it. Secure the paper with yet more masking tape so that it doesn't get blown onto the wet paint. Make sure all masking tape is firmly fitted to the car, by running your fingers along the edge of the tape. Spray Paint. Leave for another week. Now paint the black lines going the other way. (The gaps in the black lines were left to start with, not painted out in white later on.) Because of the grid nature, and leaving gaps in the black lines, you may need more than two visits to get the full pattern. Once you have your grid, use the same techniques you used for the black lines and paint in the coloured squares. Touch up the gaps between the colours and the black with black model paint. Go for a drive.<P>It's took me over a year and a half of occasional days on idle week-ends to almost complete the car. It could have been done a lot quicker, but then Rome could have been built in a day if it was only meant to last a day.<P>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD COLSPAN=2>        	<CENTER> <IMG SRC="BackEnd.jpeg" ALT="Leo outside parents' house" WIDTH=318 HEIGHT=163 BORDER=0><P>        	</CENTER>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="../punch.gif" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=18 ALT=""></TD>        <TD><A NAME="You_Paint"><H1>How To Paint Your Car</H1></A>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD></TD>        <TD>It's actually pretty hard to paint a whole car. But here are the best bits of advice I can give.<P>Start with a car the right base colour. Painting the whole car in white to start with was a real pain, and also caused me the most problems. Bits flake off because you didn't sand enough, or it flakes later because the surface wasn't totally dry. Worst of all, you uncover bits of rust that were otherwise the same colour as the car. Finally, your standard spray paint just isn't up to the job. If your car is the <EM>wrong colour,</EM> then see about getting the job done professionally; it can cost about the same as to buy all the paint in the first place.<P>Take your time! I made many mistakes by rushing it. And pick your time to. Make sure it's a nice sunny day, not too hot, not too dry, not too much breeze, but not too still either. And take it slow. It took me a long time finding the right days. If you have a large garage, life is a lot easier. It doesn't really matter if it rains on the car half an hour after the paint goes on.<P>Don't buy paint from Halfords, because it is <EM>completely useless.</EM><P>Don't drink heavily after inhaling all those paint fumes. The results are not fun in the slightest.<P>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD COLSPAN=2>            <CENTER><IMG SRC="LeftBack.jpeg" ALT="Left Back of Mondrian Car" WIDTH=369 HEIGHT=185><P></CENTER>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="../punch.gif" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=18 ALT=""></TD>        <TD><A NAME="Reactions"><H1>People's Reactions</H1></A>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD></TD>        <TD>You'd have thought you could paint a car like that, and people would be curious. No such thing. Most people in this world walk around with the heads hung low, so they never see it. Even when I'm in the road painting the car, most people avoid looking at it. Occasionally, when I'm not around, I've seen people have a good look.<P>Basically, if you get a fancy car, expect to be ignored.<P>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="../punch.gif" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=18 ALT=""></TD>        <TD><A NAME="Misc"><H1>Miscellaneous Bits & Bobs</H1></A>        </TD>    </TR>    <TR>        <TD></TD>        <TD>Having one side of your car painted a different colour to the other is actually really useful: you can drive past a police car at 150 miles per hour, and then zoom in behind a lorry. When you passed the police they saw a white car, when they pass you with their lights flashing they see a red car. Instant escape from prosecution.<P>Some people think Leo is a very decadent car.

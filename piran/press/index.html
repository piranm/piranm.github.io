Part of the press coverage that I got when I changed my name was on local TV, on TVS's
evening news programme: Coast to Coast. I was their piece of amusement at the end of
the show, after the weather forecast. They came to film me opening a bank account at <A
HREF="http://www.barclays.co.uk/">Barclays Bank</A>, North Street, <A
HREF="http://www.brighton.co.uk/">Brighton</A>.<P>

I should also point out that this is one of the most embarrassing things in my entire
life. I never show the video to anyone, and that's why there's no movie on this page,
just stills, and they're bad enough. Cringe.<P>

Here's what happened.<P>

<DT>The famous Fred Dinenage in Studio says:<DD>

Finally, a student from Brighton has decided that he's a bit unhappy with his name; I
know what he means. So Piran [mis-pronounced as Pie Ran] Montford changed his name by
deed poll. It's now an amazing ten names long, and has nearly three times as many
letters as the alphabet. Natalie Gray reports.<P>


<DT>Cut to me walking into the bank. Natalie Gray says:<DD>

<IMG SRC="tvs_bank.jpeg" ALT="Me prancing into bank" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120><br>

Meet Piran Dibdin NanKivell Aglio &AElig;lius Raphael Odo Diggory Denzil Montford. He
got his new name on Thursday, and is it for the first time today to open a bank
account.<P>



<DT>I sit down in front of bank assistant, and she says:<DD>

That's fine, can I have your name please.<P>



<DT>I say:<DD>

Yes, it's Piran Dibdin NanKivell Aglio &AElig;lius Raphael Odo Diggory Denzil
Montford.<P>



<DT>Look of shock on assistant's face. She says:<DD>

<IMG SRC="tvs_shock.jpeg" ALT="Look of shock" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120><br>

I beg your pardon. [Actually unrehearsed!]<P>



<DT>I repeat:<DD>

Piran Dibdin NanKivell Aglio...<P>



<DT>The reporter does a voice over<DD>

Piran used to be plain old Piran Dibdin Montford. He decided to change it, not because
it was a mouthful, but because it was too short.<P>



<DT>Cut to interview with me. I'm saying:<DD>

<IMG SRC="tvs_interview.jpeg" ALT="Me being interviewed" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120><br>

It's mainly to maintain the family names. Most of them are dying out, as you can
probably imagine.<P>



<DT>She asks:<DD>

But what was wrong with plain old Piran Dibdin Montford?<P>



<DT>I reply:<DD>

I suppose it was too short.<P>



<DT>She asks:<DD>

Don't you think that ten names is going a bit over the top?<P>



<DT>I reply:<DD>

May be not. May be I'll add a few more in a few years time. I quite like the name
Pip.<P>



<DT>Cut to reporter talking with me and assistant in the background.<DD>

<IMG SRC="tvs_end.jpeg" ALT="End of Report" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120><br>

The only thing that bothers me is what's going to happen when he gets married. I mean
can you imagine trying to remember all those names when you're standing there in
church. I'm not even going to try. <P>

Natalie Gray, Coast to Coast, Brighton.<P>



<DT>Back to studio with Fred Dinenage and Fern Brittain. She says:<DD>

<IMG SRC="tvs_go_home.jpeg" ALT="Back in Studio" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120><br>

What about filling in all those little forms that want your name and address, and you
can't get it all in.<P>



<DT>Fred's final words for the programme:<DD>

What about going home for tea.<P>

            <p>Queen’s Park – Brighton’s most attractive park – boasts an exotic and unexpected history, told in this
                beautifully produced book.
            </p>

            <p>
                The origin of Queen’s Park was the setting for grand villas – as shown in the watercolour by the
                architect Charles Barry on the book’s cover. Queen’s Park retains much of its original 19th century
                character.
            </p>

            <p>
                With vivid descriptions and testimonies, first hand accounts and a cast of local characters, the book
                tells the story of the park from seventy years before its grand opening, right up to the present day.
            </p>

            <p>
                After reading this book you will surely want to visit the park, if not for the first time, then with new
                eyes.

            Conversations with Sarah Rose Cook of Carlton Hill by Sara Yoemans:
            One woman growing up in the 1930s Brighton: the spoken diary of Sarah Rose Cook
        </p>
        <p>
            Sara Yeomans writes, "I met Mrs Cook in 1972, when we were living in Kemp Town in what had once been
            the servants' quarters of a grand house in Lewes Crescent."
        </p>
        <p>
            The ‘spoken diary’ is an account of one woman growing up in 1920s and 1930s Brighton. There are
            recollections of how Mrs Cook lived as a child, the excitements and incidents that accompanied
            working-class life at the time in Brighton. Local streets, local shops, rented rooms, stalls,
            parties, and the beach and hotels in the town act as backdrop to her recollections.
        </p>
        <p>
            The stories were written down in 1972 and 1973, when Sarah Cook was 67 and Sara Yeomans was 29. Some
            of the notes were written down by Sarah Cook and ‘posted through the letterbox’ when there was
            something to add to the memories, others told over ‘non-stop cups of tea’.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also a contribution from one of the daughters of Mrs Cook. Sara Yeomans went on to be an
            acclaimed novelist.

            From the Introduction:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "This booklet contains a selection of photographs from the exhibition of Mark Whenman's work. It
                is published to coincide with the show at Brighton Museum from 6 February - 19 May 1997.
            </p>
            <p>
                "[Mark's] work has been varied and has included work for Kodak as a photographer at the 1992
                Barcelona Olympic Games… Since then Mark has worked mainly in Brighton and has exhibited work in
                the Brighton Festival Expo… 1997 saw his first solo exhibitions entitled 'Colourworks'
            </p>
            <p>
                "'Photographic Memories' began as a personal study of Brighton and Hove and draws on his own
                childhood memories. This evolved into a two year project which took on a broader view and has
                captured a side of Brighton and Hove which has remained unaltered amidst constant change."

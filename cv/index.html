        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior agile developer, working front-end and back-end across a range of roles from Developer, Architect, Project Manager, Scrum Master, Consultant, and in a range of industries; in particular in agile development teams in e&#8209;commerce for well-known organisations. Whatever my role, I’ve always been hands-on with development, and won’t task something that I couldn’t do myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the design of a system is how you build it and maintain it. With a broad view of development and beyond, I’ve a keen insight into what’s required to get started and keep working, while removing dependencies and risk between streams. My focus is on delivering working software to the customer, not just the technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background is in Java/Groovy, but I work in React and other front-end technologies, and infrastructure. This allows me to work across a range of systems and technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus has been in Agile techniques, and especially Extreme Programming, particularly where it comes to the team rather than the individual. I’m a fan of pair programming, for both learning and quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve always been client facing, dealing with both business and technical contacts. I've run courses for internal teams and external clients.

        Senior developer, agile, microservices, training, scrum master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brought in to fulfil a need for an experienced agile development, I worked on a high-frequency transactional platform driving multiple front-ends. I principally worked on the back-end, built on Spring&nbsp;Boot's microservice framework, including Spring Cloud. The development was in the Java-based Groovy language on top of SpringBoot, MySQL, REST. We built for a varied set of microservice consumers, with performance, caching and stability key concerns across HTTP, internal caches, database usage, and consuming third-party REST and WebSocket services.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also worked on the AngularJS and Angular front-ends, bringing my backend skills to pair programming and  code reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to quickly embed myself with the existing team. The system grew quickly in load and features, requiring fast development and delivery, and a design for rapid growth. I promoted a more TDD-based development approach, and created tools to ease system testing which supported this, which also recovered lost requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company pivoted, moving development offshore to Kiev. I took on the additional roles of Scrum Master and KT&nbsp;Manager, in charge of bringing the Ukrainian team on board. I trained them in the business area, the technical stack and architecture, Scrum and agile process, and developments skills often through pair programming. I gave tutorials on areas such as Groovy and Spock, Scrum, British English language and humour, and the rules of cricket. I also created training documentation and system documentation, and managed the training plan and visits.
      </p>

      <p>
        1<sup>st</sup> Project: Defining and implementing non-functional requirements for an existing project, and passing on to support team. I created the security model. Technologies: Java, Hibernate and Spring&nbsp;Boot, REST microservices. I also updated the build & deploy process: Groovy and Jenkins Pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        2<sup>nd</sup> Project: A client on a tight deadline had failed to enter integration testing. I was technical representative on a SWAT team for process and strategy to bring the project back on track. New targets were set, the process defined, and trackable deliverables defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        3<sup>rd</sup> Project: Implementing Oracle’s Endeca Experience Manager onto a client’s existing Endeca and Oracle Commerce/ATG implementation. Introduced BackstopJS testing to ensure no visible front-end regressions. Implementation was Java and JavaScript.

        This was a hands-on dev role, building the infrastructure and import mechanisms to load a variety of Harry Potter related data into Google’s BigQuery engine. We created a repeatable build & deploy system for BigQuery, with a TDD framework for loading and stored queries. The tooling was Groovy on Heroku. I worked with the knowledge-holders to define requirements and understand the data.

          <span class="title">LEGO: Solution Architect</span>
          <span class="dates">Jan 2015 - Sep 2016</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          This was my second engagement as architect with LEGO’s on-line store, a flagship site supporting heavy traffic for a global audience. The role implemented LEGO's first microservice architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting as a consultancy role to specify LEGO’s strategic move to a microservices, I took part in workshops defining their global federated microservice architecture. We defined the company's requirements for an API Gateway, deployment and rollout planning, and how standards could be achieved across varied systems. LEGO's on-line shop was chosen as the pioneer project, and I transferred onto that project.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the role of Solution Architect, I specified a new implementation of their new system. The microservice back-end was implemented in Java & Spring on top of an existing Oracle Commerce (aka&nbsp;ATG) store. The REST endpoints were exposed using an Apigee API gateway. The front-end was isomorphic ReactJS hosted on AWS ElasticBeanstalk. OAuth2.0 secured the system at the API gateway, with traditional Java servlet session management to ATG behind. Both front-end and APIs were heavily cached in Akamai. There were integrations to 40+ other systems, and a I worked to ensure a workable deliverable from a third-party designing a new look & feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as the design, technical direction and liaison, I worked defining work streams and deliverables. In specific areas, I also built test harnesses to enable TDD development with Akamai caching, Apigee API Gateway, Adobe Test & Target and analytics. With a rollout of so many new systems, I designed a staged go-live to ensure stability and continuity. The project was successfully delivered against the hard deadline of LEGO's peak period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new site was built to run in parallel with the existing implementation, a site I had been architect for previously, and which had won Oracle ATG’s Implementation of the Year.

        <p>
          Part of a team initially brought on board to improve stability, I worked on integrating a new payment provider and handle requirements for Chinese ecommerce rollout. Built in Java on an existing Oracle Commerce/ATG system including CSC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particularly successful, I created a testing framework that allowed testing of the asynchronous queued fulfilment and payment modules; this allowed us to recreate the lost requirements through tests, and to ensure no regression during re-implementation.

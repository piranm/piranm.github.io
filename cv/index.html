    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a senior agile developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve worked in a range of roles: from hard-core Developer, to Architect, to Project Manager, to Consultant, across a range of industries; in particular in leading teams in e&#8209;commerce for well-known organisations. Whatever the role, I’ve always been hands-on,
      and won’t task something that I couldn’t do myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the design of a system is how you build it, whether that be a bridge or software. As a broad-spectrum developer I’ve a keen insight into what’s required to get started, and keep working, while removing dependency risk between streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve always been client facing, dealing with both business and technical contacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background is in Java/Groovy, but I’ve a keen interest in JavaScript, ReactJS and front-end technologies, and infrastructure work. This allows me to talk across systems and development streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve also worked in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQL, Google BigQuery, AngularJS, Heroku, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      My focus has been in Agile techniques, and especially Extreme Programming, particularly where it comes to the team rather than the individual. I’m a huge fan of pair programming, for both learning and quality.
    </p>

  <p>
    This was a very hands-on role, building the infrastructure and import mechanisms to load a variety of data into Google’s BigQuery engine. The tooling was Groovy on Heroku. Also working with the knowledge-holders to define requirements and understand the
    data.

      <span class="title">LEGO: Solution Architect</span>
      <span class="dates">Jan 2015 - Sep 2016</span>
    </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a second engagement as architect with LEGO’s on-line store, a flagship site supporting heavy traffic for a global audience. I was part of the e2x team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting as a consultancy role about LEGO’s strategic move to a SOA/microservice architecture; their on-line shop was chosen as the first project.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the role of “Solution Architect”, I specified a isomorphic ReactJS front-end, hosted on AWS ElasticBeanstalk, using a REST interface via Apigee API gateway; both were heavily cached in Akamai. The back-end was implemented on top of an already running
      ATG ecommerce store; monitoring was in Dynatrace and ELK. OAuth2.0 secured the system at the front-end, with traditional session management behind. There are integrations to 40+ other systems, and a new front-end was being designed
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as design and technical direction and liaison, I worked defining work streams and deliverables. In specific areas, I also built test harnesses to enable TDD development with Akamai, Apigee and analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contract through e2x&nbsp;Ltd.

    </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of an e2x team initially brought on board to improve stability, I worked on integrating a new payment provider and handle requirements for Chinese ecommerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly successful was implementing a testing framework that allowed testing of the asynchronous queuing fulfilment and payment modules; this allowed us through tests to recreate the missing requirements, and to ensure no regression tests during
      implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built on an existing Oracle Commerce/ATG system including CSC. Contract through e2x&nbsp;Ltd.

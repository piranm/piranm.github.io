        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior agile developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve worked in a range of roles: from Developer, to Architect, to Project Manager, to Consultant, across a range of industries; in particular in leading agile development teams in e&#8209;commerce for well-known organisations. Whatever the role, I’ve always been hands-on with development, and won’t task something that I couldn’t attempt myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the design of a system is how you build it, whether that be a bridge or software. As a broad-spectrum developer I’ve a keen insight into what’s required to get started, and keep working, while removing dependency risk between streams.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background is in Java/Groovy, but I’ve an active interest in JavaScript, ReactJS and front-end technologies, and infrastructure work. This allows me to talk across systems and development streams.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve also worked in JavaScript, SQL, Ruby on Rails, Google BigQuery, AngularJS, Heroku, Oracle Commerce/ATG, Hybris and many others.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus has been in Agile techniques, and especially Extreme Programming, particularly where it comes to the team rather than the individual. I’m a huge fan of pair programming, for both learning and quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve always been client facing, dealing with both business and technical contacts. I've run courses for internal teams and external clients.

        <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>
        <p>
          I’m now available and looking for senior developer roles, usually contracting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am based in central London.

        Senior developer, agile, microservices, training, teaching cricket to Ukrainians, scrum master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brought in to fill a gap in experienced agile development, I worked on a high-frequency transactional platform. Built on a microservice architecture driving multiple front-ends, based on Spring, Spring&nbsp;Boot, Groovy, MySQL, REST, AngularJS and Angular. The system was growing quickly in terms of usage and features, requiring fast development and delivery, and built for rapid growth. I had to quickly embed myself with the existing team, and brought in more TDD and a tool for more expressive integration testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company pivoted, moving development offshore to Kiev. I was elevated to Scrum Master and KT&nbsp;Manager, in charge of the training for the team hired in Kiev. I trained them in the business area, the technical stack and architecture, Scrum and agile process, and developments skills. I gave tutorials on areas such as Groovy and Spock, rules of cricket, British English language and humour, and Scrum. I also created on-boarding training documentation and system documentation, and managed the training plan.

        This was a very hands-on dev role, building the infrastructure and import mechanisms to load a variety of data into Google’s BigQuery engine. We created a repeatable build & deploy system for BigQuery, with a TDD framework for loading and stored queries. The tooling was Groovy on Heroku. Also working with the knowledge-holders to define requirements and understand the data.

        <p>
          This was a second engagement as architect with LEGO’s on-line store, a flagship site supporting heavy traffic for a global audience. The role implemented LEGO's first microservice architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting as a consultancy role to direct LEGO’s strategic move to a microservice architecture, I took part in workshops defining their global microservice architecture. We defined the company's requirements for an API Gateway, deployment and roll-out planning, and how standards could be achieved across varied systems. LEGO's on-line shop was chosen as the pioneer project, and I transfered onto that project.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the role of “Solution Architect”, I specified a new implementation of their entire system. The front-end was isomorphic ReactJS hosted on AWS ElasticBeanstalk. The REST microservices were exposed using an Apigee API gateway as the start of LEGO's microservice architecture. Both front-end and APIs were heavily cached in Akamai, for which I created TDD driven test harness to drive the rules. The back-end was implemented in Java & Spring on top of an existing Oracle Commerce (aka&nbsp;ATG) store. Monitoring was in Dynatrace and ELK. OAuth2.0 secured the system at the API gateway, with traditional session management to ATG behind. There were integrations to 40+ other systems, and a new front-end look & feel was being designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as design and technical direction and liaison, I worked defining work streams and deliverables. In specific areas, I also built test harnesses to enable TDD development with Akamai, Apigee, Adobe Test & Target and analytics. With a roll-out of so many new systems, I designed a staged roll-out to ensure stability and continuity. The project was successfully delivered against the hard deadline of LEGO's peak period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new site was built to run in parallel with the exisitng implementaiton, a site I had been architect for previously, and which had won Oracle ATG’s Implementation of the Year. For both projects I was a contractor through e2x&nbsp;Ltd.

          Part of a team initially brought on board to improve stability, I worked on integrating a new payment provider and handle requirements for Chinese ecommerce roll-out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particularly successful, I created a testing framework that allowed testing of the asynchronous queued fulfilment and payment modules; this allowed us to recreate the lost requirements through tests, and to ensure no regression tests during implementation.
